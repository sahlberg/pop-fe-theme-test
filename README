This is the README file for the the test theme for pop-fe.
It contains a single entry for the game GranTurismo2 in the subdirectory
data/SCES02380.
In this directory we have four files for the emtadata when creating a
PS3 PKG for this game.
ICON0.PNG  : the disc cover
PIC0/PIC.PNG  : the two screenshots
SND0.WAV : An audio file that will play

There need to be one such sudirectory for each game that the theme supports.
If a theme is choosen but there it does not contain data for the game then
pop-fe will fall back to just using a random image as it has always has done.

The test data in data/SCES02380 is actually images and audio from the
game FinalFantasy VII. You can test this by creating a package of SCES02380
using this theme. It should create a PKG for GranTurismo2 but it will
use assets for FinalFantasyVII.

This README should also contain information about the style used and guidelines
for how to create new entries to be contributed to this theme.
